# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
## Internship Project

## 🔍 Project Title:
Sales Data Analysis of a Commercial Store

## 🏢 Organization:
This project is part of my internship with Brainwave Matrix Solutions.

## 📁 Dataset:
- Name: Sample Superstore
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Microsoft Excel (for preliminary cleaning)
- PowerPoint (for final presentation)
- GitHub (version control)

## 📌 Objectives:
- Analyze sales data to understand patterns, trends, and outliers.
- Identify top-performing categories, sub-categories, and regions.
- Explore the effect of discounts on profit.
- Provide insights for business decision-making.

## 📊 Key Insights:
- Technology category had the highest average profit .
- Central region had the highest average discount offered.
- Certain high-discount products lead to negative profits.
- Opportunities exist in optimizing shipping modes and regional focus.

## 📈 Analysis Performed:
- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Descriptive Statistics
- Grouped Analysis by Category, Region, and Sub-Category
- Correlation Analysis between Sales, Discount, and Profit
- Visualizations using bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts

## 📎 Files Included:
- Sales_Analysis.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook with analysis
- Sample- Superstore.xls(Superstore.xls.csv.xlsx): Raw dataset used

# Project Title- 🧠 Social Media Sentiment Analysis (Twitter)
This project analyzes public sentiment towards a product (e.g., iPhone 15) using sample Twitter data. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories, and visualizes the results.

## 📌 Features
- Clean and preprocess tweet text using Python
- Perform sentiment classification using TextBlob (or VADER)
- Visualize:
  - Sentiment distribution (Pie chart)
  - Sentiment trend over time (Line graph)
  - WordCloud of most used words in positive tweets (fallback for all tweets if none positive)
    
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud, TextBlob)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sample CSV dataset (offline-friendly)
  
## 🧾 Files Included
- `Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter notebook with analysis
- `sample_tweets.csv` – Simulated tweet dataset for offline use
  
## 📈 How It Works
1. Load tweet dataset
2. Clean and normalize text (remove URLs, hashtags, punctuation, etc.)
3. Apply sentiment scoring
4. Visualize key trends and insights
   
## ✅ Output Snapshots
- Pie chart of sentiment
- Time series plot of sentiments by date
- WordCloud of key tweet terms

## 📚 Future Enhancements
- Connect live to Twitter API
- Multi-language sentiment support
- Real-time dashboard using Streamlit or Flask
